            10. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
          </div>
          <div class="list_content">

            <p class="info">There’s a reason Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been popular for as long as it has: it’s one of the most focused and technical first-person shooters out there, with a heavy reliance on team-based dynamics, game sense, and pure skill. Its challenge and depth don’t just make it one of the toughest competitive shooters to master, it also makes it the most rewarding. CS:GO did a lot to make the Counter-Strike formula appealing to serious players and newcomers alike, and it’s now entirely free-to-play. Competitive matchmaking and a ranking system adds a way to track skill and progress, while built-in casual modes offer a reliable place to practice. Integration with Steam Workshop also allows for quick installation of useful training maps. While Counter-Strike can be an intimidating game to pick up, those with the patience and dedication to learn the complexities of this team-based shooter are in for one heck of a ride.</p>

            9. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
         </div>
          <div class="list_content">
            <p class="release"><b>Release Date: </b>October 21, 2016</p>

            <p class="info">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey picks up (mechanically) where Origins left off, continuing the series’ evolution from stealth-sandbox to action/RPG. Taking place roughly 400 years before the events of AC Origins, Odyssey’s rendition of Ancient Greece is as gorgeous as the series (or games in general, quite frankly) has ever been. Traversing its verdant forests and rocky hills or sailing shining seas of the Mediterranean always offers something new to find or an ancient ruin to explore, and its combat is equal parts arcadey fun and ARPG-style strategy. The new skill trees offer dozens of abilities useful both in and out of a fight, though the combat-centric ones like the 300-inspired Spartan Kick and brutally satisfying Shield Breaker often steal the show. While it may not feature the best voice acting the series has ever seen, the main campaign succeeds at offering a compelling story with characters we found ourselves genuinely invested in - although its 50-60 hour critical path does feel a bit bloated with errands and fetch quests. That said, with all there is to explore beyond the confines of the core adventure (historical inaccuracies notwithstanding), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey stands out as a must-play title of the current generation.</p>

            8. Resident Evil 2
         </div>

            <p class="info">Resident Evil 2 has set the bar impossibly high for remakes and remasters of classic games by reimagining the 1998 original. But more importantly, it’s become the gold standard of survival horror in 2019. The derelict corridors of the Racoon City Police Department are brimming with both tension and action, which is a difficult balance to achieve in and of itself, but is just the beginning of Resident Evil 2’s triumphs. Each item, weapon, and enemy is part of a brilliant ecosystem that either hastens or hinders your progress through it. Even your run-of-the-mill zombie presents a unique obstacle in the sense that the ones you’ve already “killed” sometimes come back “life.” It’s up to you to decide whether or not it’s worth it to expend valuable resources like shotgun shells or plywood boards to deal with them for good. As new elements are introduced old ones gain new meaning, and the bigger picture becomes a bit more clear. Throw in an excellent narrative, brilliant level design, and a wealth of addition modes and playthrough options, and Resident Evil 2 is more than worthy of your time.</p>

            <p class="info">Fortnite’s Battle Royale quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, but its fast and frequent updates have shown it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Its free-to-play format and relatively simple shooting mechanics make it a significantly more accessible take on the battle royale shooter. But that’s coupled with unique building tools that push its skill cap sky high.

            <p class="info">MOBAs have earned a reputation for being dense and difficult to learn, but immensely strategic for those who put in the time. Spend some quality time with Dota 2 and you’ll understand why. Though all matches take place on one map, and there’s only one objective, its 100+ characters and thousands of item combinations make each round feel unique. And because every second matters, matches are always exciting even when they seem slow. Are you farming gold? Are you scouting the enemy? Or crossing the map to help out a teammate? Or heading back to base to heal? Its complexity can scare players off, but those who stick through it will be rewarded with some of the most strategic gameplay around.</p>

            5. Warframe
         </div>
          <div class="list_content">
            <p class="release"><b>Release Date: </b>March 25, 2013</p>

            <p class="info">Warframe first launched six years ago, but it just keeps getting better and better. It’s an often overlooked co-op action game that can quickly be summed up as “space ninjas,” and t’s undoubtedly grown past that moniker over the years. You can dash through space ships at breakneck speeds, smash and shoot enemies with dozens of varied weapons, fly over and explore large open world areas, and more recently even follow a story line that’s surprisingly engaging compared to where Warframe started. The look and feel of Warframe has evolved over the years as well, with far-stretching systems changes and huge graphical overhauls that keep it from looking dated. Digital Extremes is one of the most dedicated developers around, and constant free updates and additions mean Warframe always stays engaging and fresh. But even as more content comes, there are already enough missions to play and items to collect to keep you playing for hundreds of hours.</p>

            <p class="info">Minecraft is the greatest video game about playing with blocks. It’s excellent for many reasons, but the most important is that it both encourages and enables a childlike sense of wonder. That mountain in the distance? You can burrow into it. You can make your home inside it and cover it with lava so it’s spooky and cool. And then you can dig deep into the ground to find treasure and fight monsters. Some dedicated players have even recreated famous spaceships and even built working virtual 3D printers within their worlds. Minecraft can be played as a do-what-you-want sandbox, but there are enough game systems and rules to structure your time into a “campaign,” if that’s what you’re after. Few games have set the world on fire like Minecraft, and it’s likely few ever will in the same way again.</p>

            <p class="info">Deep, lengthy RPGs are a staple of PC gaming, and very few have put a larger chunk of sophisticated content forward than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has. Its massive sandbox open-world areas impress, both in terms of scope and density; they’re generously dotted with great monsters to slay, tantalizing mysteries to solve, and personal stories to unfurl. It’s also one of the most impressive overall productions in gaming history, with reams of excellently written dialogue performed by a stellar voice cast, an incredible original soundtrack, and graphics that qualify as both a technical and artistic achievement.</p>

            <p class="info">League of Legends is at the forefront of the esports explosion. Back when the only big MOBA was the original Defense of the Ancients, League took the formula and tweaked it, resulting in a more accessible game that still offers immense depth for those who want to dive in deep. Its 132 heroes are fun, varied, and tough to master, and can be customized even further by rune and mastery systems. Developer Riot Games is also pioneering new practices in competitive gaming, hiring teams to play seasons and earn spots in exciting playoff matches, just like you’d see in traditional sports. 20 years down the line, the documentary that looks back on the beginning of esports will credit League of Legends as the tipping point.

            <p class="info">Portal 2 claims the top spot because, in the past decade, nothing else has struck so many chords so perfectly. No game accomplishes so much so well. Its impeccable level design, charming personality, and exceptional and varied puzzle systems make us feel smarter just for getting through it. Plus, its co-op campaign requires a different sort of smarts that remains one of the best multiplayer experiences with pals around. Valve is a developer that, presumably because of the time it takes to make its incredible games, creates a feeling of timelessness in its design. Portal 2 – which iterated on and added to the brilliant puzzle design and world-building of its predecessor – feels just as clever and unique as it did in 2011. Simply put, if you’ve never played Portal 2, your top gaming priority right now should be to do just that.
